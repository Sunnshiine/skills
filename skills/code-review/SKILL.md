description: "Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along two axes: Standards (is the code well made, by this repo's documented standards and a Fowler smell baseline?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/spec asked for?). Runs both reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side, each with a verdict. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to \"review since X\"."

Two-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point:

- **Standards**: is the code well made, by this repo's documented standards and the smell baseline?
- **Spec**: does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / spec?

Both axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point (a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc.). If they didn't specify one, use the merge-base with the default branch and say so in the report.

Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here, not inside two parallel sub-agents.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages or PR body (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.), fetched from the repo's issue tracker.
2. A path the user passed as an argument.
3. A spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. If nothing is found, the **Spec** sub-agent skips and the report says "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Search the repo for every file that documents how code should be written. When `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` exists, it must be on the list.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below: **code judo** plus a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, 2nd ed., ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

**Code judo** comes first: a behaviour-preserving reshape that makes whole branches, flags, helpers, or layers disappear, using the architecture that already exists. Name it with a sketch of the new shape (pseudocode or a diff sketch), not "could be cleaner". A reshape that moves complexity around without deleting any is not code judo.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff and the code around it:

- **Mysterious Name**: a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code**: the same logic shape appears twice in the change, or the change rebuilds a helper or a derived fact the codebase already owns. → extract the shared shape, or call the existing owner and delete the copy.
- **Long Function / Large Class**: the diff grows a function or file past what a reader can hold (a file crossing ~1,000 lines is the usual tell). → extract the part that changes for its own reason.
- **Feature Envy**: a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps**: the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession**: a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches**: the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Temporary Field**: a flag, mode, or optional field that only some paths set or read. → move it into the type or state that owns that path.
- **Mutable Data**: related state updated in steps that can leave it half-applied. → derive it, or update it in one step.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change**: one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality**: abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Lazy Element**: a wrapper, parameter, or branch that no longer earns its place, including dead code the change left behind. → inline or delete it.
- **Message Chains**: long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man**: a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest**: a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Name the weak spot

Read the diff yourself and write one question naming its likeliest structural weak spot ("should name and ordinal be one identity type?", "should these three stop paths be one result type?"). It points the Standards sub-agent at the place a reshape is most likely; the sub-agent still reviews the whole diff.

### 5. Spawn both sub-agents in parallel

Issue both sub-agent calls together, in the foreground, and aggregate the reports they return.

Both briefs carry the same **calibration**: tag each finding `now` when the diff introduces or worsens it, `follow-up` when it predates the diff, and open the report with a verdict line: `BLOCK` (a `now` finding the author should fix before merge), `APPROVE+NOTES`, or `APPROVE`. Only `now` findings can block. At most 8 findings, no cosmetic nits.

**Standards sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full (the sub-agent has no other access to it).
- The weak-spot question from step 4.
- The calibration above.
- The brief: "Read the surrounding code at `HEAD`, not just the hunks. Lead with any code judo reshape, sketched. Then report, per file/hunk, (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls: documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 500 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The calibration above.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

### 6. Aggregate

Present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned, each with its verdict line. Do **not** merge or rerank findings, because the two axes are deliberately separate (see _Why two axes_).

End with a one-line summary: each axis's verdict, its finding count, and its worst issue (if any). Don't pick a single winner or a single verdict across axes: that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
